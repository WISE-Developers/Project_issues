This repository is the primary project management repo and is used to catch all bugs, tasks and Feature requests as well as website feedback.

## Project Known Issues

At this time the WISE executable (The Engine) is correctly running simulations from a model file (*.FGMJ) on all platforms.

Builder is not yet proven working, nor is the JS API, but these are being worked on currently and you should expect this status to change quickly.

Best to keep your eye on this project, it will be up to date and shows whats working and whats not.
